# wordo
Yet another Wordle clone...
Written in HTML, CSS, & vanilla JS. 

Play it here, on desktop or mobile! https://bdacoscos.github.io/wordo/ 

## To Do
As you can tell, this game is NOT complete. Needs some more work!
1. Add message alerts re: game play (i.e., winning guess will signal game is over, display a friendly alert)
2. Animate tiles
3. Add social share ability--generate emoji tiles with user's guess attempts
4. Call an API to get a random word (no more hard-coding)
5. Make layout look nicer on desktop
